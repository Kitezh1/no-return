                        </p>

                        <p>As a new day dawns, Harris gathers his gear and prepares to venture further into the forest. Before he leaves, Mal approaches him, handing him a notebook and a pencil. She looks at him with concern in her eyes and says, "Harris,
                            please take this. As you explore, draw a map of the area. It might help us navigate and find our way back if we get separated."</p>

                        <p>Harris nods, understanding the importance of having a visual guide. "Thanks, Mal. I'll make sure to mark down everything I come across," he replies, securing the notebook in his bag.</p>

                        <p>With a determined expression, Harris sets out into the dense forest, gradually disappearing from Mal's sight. Left behind at camp, Nikki and Mal occupy themselves with tending to the crops and engaging in heartfelt conversations,
                            gradually building a stronger bond between them.</p>

                        <p>Days pass, and still, there is no sign of Harris returning to camp. Nikki voices her concerns to Mal, worry etched on her face. "I can't help but worry about Harris. He's been gone for days now. What if something happened to him
                            out there?" she expresses, her voice tinged with anxiety.</p>

                        <p>Mal tries to offer reassurance, mustering a confident smile. "Nikki, remember that Harris is a seasoned military man. If anyone can survive on their own, it's him. I believe he's resourceful and knows how to handle himself in tough
                            situations. Let's trust in his skills and give him a bit more time," she suggests, hoping to calm Nikki's fears.</p>

                        <p>One day, as the two women head towards the river to wash their clothes, a peculiar noise cuts through the air, resembling the sound of an aircraft. They look at each other, their brows furrowed in confusion, as they witness a trail
                            of strange smoke left behind by the mysterious object. "What was that?" Nikki asks, her voice filled with uncertainty.</p>

                        <p>Mal ponders for a moment, her expression thoughtful. "It wasn't a crash pod; it was something small, flying across the sky. It didn't descend but moved horizontally. Let's hurry back to camp, just to be safe. We don't know what
                            that could mean," she suggests, a tinge of concern in her voice.</p>

                        <p>Days turn into another week, and we find ourselves with Harris, who has diligently recorded his findings in the notebook, fulfilling Mal's request. Supplies are running low, and he contemplates heading back to camp when a glimmer
                            catches his attention from behind the trees. Curiosity piqued, he cautiously makes his way towards it, revealing an old cabin in the distance.</p>

                        <p>Approaching the cabin after a few minutes of walking, Harris keeps his weapon at the ready, prepared for any potential threat. Peering through the windows, he sees no one inside, but the lingering warmth of a fire indicates recent
                            occupation. He gently pushes open the door and steps inside, his senses heightened. As he searches the cabin, he stumbles upon a stash of food and ammunition. However, his attention is quickly drawn to a drawing on the wall—an
                            intricate map adorned with symbols representing various camps in the area. His heart sinks as he notices a skull symbol accompanying some of the camps, leaving him with a sense of foreboding.</p>

                        <p>Just as Harris is about to leave, a sudden, deafening bang reverberates through the air. In an instant, he collapses to the floor, clutching his stomach, blood spilling from his wound. With fading strength, he looks up to see the
                            cabin owner standing above him. Another gunshot echoes through the room, and everything fades to darkness.</p>
