                        </p>
                        <p>A few days had passed, and Mal's condition had significantly improved. The eclipse still loomed over the rainforest, casting an eerie darkness that made it challenging for Nikki to venture out and hunt for food. On her way back
                            to the cave one day, Nikki noticed smoke rising in the sky not too far away. Alarm bells rang in her mind, and she hurried back to camp.</p>

                        <p>As Nikki entered the cave with a concerned expression, Mal noticed and inquired about what was wrong. Nikki explained about the smoke, conveying her worry. They both stepped outside the cave and gazed into the distance, observing
                            the billowing charcoal-black plumes. Sensing potential danger, Mal suggested they remain hidden and avoid any confrontations. Nikki agreed, and they extinguished the campfire to minimize the chances of being noticed.</p>

                        <p>Inside the cave, darkness enveloped them, exacerbated by the persistent eclipse. Fortunately, Mal wore a watch on her wrist, allowing them to keep track of time. The women speculated about Harris's whereabouts and contemplated
                            whether he might need their help.</p>

                        <p>Their conversation was abruptly interrupted by the sound of crying. Startled, they shot up, exchanging anxious glances, unsure of how to proceed. Nikki cautiously crept out of the cave and scanned the area, eventually spotting
                            a young woman hiding behind a bush, clutching a torch. The flickering light illuminated the blood flowing from her arm.</p>

                        <p>Nikki tapped Mal, directing her attention to the woman. Mal questioned what they should do, and they deliberated for a few minutes, weighing their options. Their thoughts were abruptly interrupted by the sight of more torches and
                            distant screams.</p>

                        <p>Overwhelmed with fear, the young girl began to weep and darted deeper into the woods. Nikki made a quick decision to help the girl, recognizing that she was fleeing imminent danger. Whispering, Nikki called out to her, trying to
                            reassure her that it was safe and she would find sanctuary in the cave. The girl's terrified eyes searched for Nikki, frozen in place.</p>

                        <p>Nikki spoke softly to the girl, offering comfort and assuring her safety in their presence. However, shrouded by darkness, the girl struggled to see Nikki. Determined, Nikki told her she would come down to retrieve her.</p>

                        <p>Approaching the illuminated torch, Nikki's approach was cautious. The girl hesitated for a moment but eventually took Nikki's hand. Leading her back to the cave, Nikki felt a surge of adrenaline as they heard the voices of men
                            drawing closer. Once safely inside the cave, Mal took the torch and extinguished it. The three women huddled together in silence, listening to the approaching footsteps and the echoes of the men's shouts reverberating through
                            the forest.</p>

                        <p>One of the men bellowed, proclaiming that they needed to eliminate everyone. Fear gripped the young girl beside Nikki, causing her to tremble. Minutes passed, and the forest once again filled with the sounds of nature, a stark
                            contrast to the recent chaos.</p>

                        <p>Nikki asked the girl if she was okay and what had happened. Tearfully, the girl recounted how she and her friends had been attacked during the night by a group of men dressed in dark clothing. Realization struck Nikki and Mal simultaneously—this
                            was the same group that had assaulted them during their early days in the wilderness.</p>

                        <p>The girl provided further details about the harrowing ordeal. Nikki realized she was causing the girl more distress and swiftly changed the subject. She asked for the girl's name, to which she replied, "Dalia."</p>

                        <p>Mal approached them with a meager meal consisting of leafy soup and scraps of chicken skin that Nikki had managed to scrounge up a few days ago. Mal jokingly admitted it wasn't much, but Dalia expressed her gratitude.</p>

                        <p>After finishing her soup, Dalia mustered the courage to ask her first question. She inquired about the duration of their time in this place. Mal explained the events and revealed that it had officially been 37 days since they first
                            crashed here. Dalia gasped, visibly taken aback.</p>

                        <p>Concerned, Nikki asked what was troubling her. Dalia, with a mix of surprise and disbelief, explained that it was also her 37th day in this bewildering wilderness.</p>
