                        </p>
                        <p>A few days had passed since they rescued Dalia, and the eclipse had finally lifted its dark shadow from the sun, bringing the first sight of light the women had seen in almost a week. The vibrant rays illuminated the rainforest,
                            casting a renewed sense of hope upon them. Over these days, the bond between the women and Dalia had grown stronger as they got to know her better.</p>

                        <p>Dalia's mechanical expertise became evident as she managed to get a small generator from one of the crash pods to work. With a flicker of electricity, they now had a lifeline to power crucial equipment when needed, although they
                            conserved it for emergencies due to limited resources.</p>

                        <p>One evening, as they sat around a dimly lit campfire, Dalia broached a topic that had been on her mind. She asked the other women if it was possible to go back to her old camp, to see if anyone else had survived. Nikki hesitated,
                            understanding the danger that awaited them. However, it was Mal who responded, voicing the concern that had been lurking in their minds. She explained the risks involved, emphasizing that they didn't know who these men were,
                            but they would kill them the moment they were spotted.</p>

                        <p>Dalia listened attentively, her eyes filled with determination. She understood the risks but felt a deep longing to find her comrades. Nikki, captivated by Dalia's bravery, interrupted and offered her support. Mal, giving her an
                            annoyed look, finally relented, realizing that their unity was their strength. She agreed to accompany them on this risky journey but cautioned that they must remain vigilant at all times.</p>

                        <p>The following morning, the women seized the opportunity presented by the sunlight. They gathered weapons, packed essential supplies, and set out towards Dalia's old camp. As they left the safety of the cave, the dense forest enveloped
                            them once again. Nikki and Dalia engaged in light conversation, exchanging stories from their past lives before the crash, while Mal led the way, her eyes scanning the surroundings with a mix of skepticism and caution.</p>

                        <p>Suddenly, Mal halted, a perplexed expression etched across her face. She strained to listen, her senses on high alert. "Did you hear that noise too?" she asked, breaking the silence. Nikki and Dalia shook their heads, unable to
                            discern anything peculiar. Mal's instincts warned her that something or someone was lurking nearby. The women gripped their weapons tightly, scanning the rustling bushes and swaying trees for any signs of movement.</p>

                        <p>A gasp escaped Nikki's lips as she heard a faint sound. Mal immediately hushed her, her eyes narrowing. Moments later, a thunderous roar pierced through the forest, followed by a vicious attack. A large jaguar pounced on top of
                            Mal, its claws tearing through her flesh, while her anguished screams filled the air. The chaotic scene unfolded in a blur of blood and terror.</p>

                        <p>Reacting swiftly, Nikki and Dalia raised their weapons, their hearts pounding with adrenaline-fueled determination. They unleashed a barrage of gunfire, targeting the enraged animal that had Mal locked in its jaws. The jaguar yelped
                            in pain, retreating from its wounded prey and vanishing into the depths of the forest, leaving a trail of purple ooze in its wake.</p>

                        <p>As the danger subsided, Nikki rushed to Mal's side, her hands trembling. The sight that awaited her was gruesome—Mal lay motionless, her body mangled by the ferocious attack. Dalia knelt beside her, her eyes wide with terror, whispering
                            words of disbelief and despair.</p>

                        <p>In a haze of grief and anger, Nikki made a solemn vow. Leaving Dalia to tend to Mal's body, she sprinted after the jaguar, blindly following the trail of purple blood. Her mind was clouded, fueled by a thirst for vengeance that
                            eclipsed all reason. Finally, she discovered the wounded jaguar, its immense form slumped against a rock, tears streaming from its eyes.</p>

                        <p>Nikki crouched behind a tree, her gun held steady, and her gaze fixed upon the suffering creature. In that fleeting moment, a flicker of empathy softened her heart. Yet, resolve overcame her as she remembered Mal's lifeless form.
                            With a steady hand, she pulled the trigger, the resounding gunshot extinguishing the jaguar's pain as its body crumpled to the ground.</p>

                        <p>Breathless and overwhelmed, Nikki retraced her steps through the thick foliage, pushing through the underbrush to return to Dalia and Mal. Her heart pounded in her chest as she burst through the final barrier. Time seemed to stand
                            still as she took in the heart-wrenching scene. Dalia knelt beside Mal, her face contorted with anguish and fear. Mal's lifeless eyes stared into the void, mirroring the darkness that had consumed their once-promising journey.</p>

                        <p>In that moment, the weight of their loss and the magnitude of their predicament crashed upon them like a tidal wave. The world they had known was shattered, and the path ahead seemed treacherous and uncertain. As they mourned the
                            fallen comrade, a newfound determination solidified within their hearts. They understood that unity and resilience would be their guiding beacons in the face of unimaginable challenges. Together, they would navigate the depths
                            of darkness and forge a new path toward survival.</p>
