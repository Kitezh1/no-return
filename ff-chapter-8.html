                        </p>

                        <p>Nikki and Mal anxiously waited inside the cave, unaware of Harris's fate. Little did they know that he had been killed. Mal had been salvaging a transmitter from their crash pod since their landing, attempting to establish communication
                            with the main ship, but all her efforts had been in vain. Nikki, curious about the progress, asked Mal how it was going. Mal sighed and replied, "No luck so far, Nikki. I've been trying, but it's like there's no one on the
                            other end." </p>

                        <p> Fatigue starting to weigh on her, Mal was on the verge of falling asleep when a sudden beep emanated from the transmitter. Startled, both women rushed to check the message, only to be bewildered by a series of random numbers and
                            symbols. Mal, perplexed, explained to Nikki that this wasn't a glitch—it seemed to be a deliberate message. But who it was from and what it meant remained a mystery.</p>

                        <p>After some restless sleep, the women woke up to the sound of heavy rainfall outside the cave. Deciding it was best to stay sheltered for the day, their solitude was interrupted by the arrival of a man. Instantly on guard, they
                            grabbed their weapons and aimed at him, Mal shouting for him to stop. As the man approached, Nikki recognized him as the same person they had encountered a few days ago. Realizing he meant no harm, they cautiously lowered their
                            weapons and sat around the campfire with him.</p>

                        <p>The man shared his concern about some of his people mysteriously disappearing. Nikki, wanting to help, mentioned that their friend Harris hadn't returned either, speculating that he may have been taken by another group. They engaged
                            in conversation with the peaceful man, exchanging stories and insights before bidding him farewell as he returned to his own camp.</p>

                        <p>Days passed, and Nikki and Mal found themselves facing dwindling food supplies. With Harris still absent, they resolved to try hunting on their own. Venturing into the woods, they searched for signs of animals. Mal was growing
                            disheartened when Nikki whispered, drawing her attention to a deer not too far away. Mal aimed her weapon, ready to take a shot, but something stopped her. Nikki questioned her hesitation, and Mal explained that the deer resembled
                            the one they had encountered earlier, with its bulging red eyes and foaming mouth.</p>

                        <p>Concerned for their safety, Mal and Nikki decided to retreat to their camp, grappling with the uncertainty of how they would survive with their dwindling food supply. On their way back, a growl echoed through the air, causing them
                            to spin around. They locked eyes with a feral wolf, its ragged appearance sending a shiver down their spines.</p>
