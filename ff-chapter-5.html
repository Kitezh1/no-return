                        </p>
                        <p>Two weeks had passed since they had established their new camp near a cave, and the arrival of summer brought a new sense of hope to the group. Inside the cave, their sleeping arrangements and belongings were safely stored, while
                            outside, crops grew steadily under the care of their makeshift garden. Mal had managed to extract seeds from various plants in the area, ensuring a sustainable source of food. Harris had proven his hunting skills, successfully
                            catching animals like deer and foxes. Nikki, in her role as the cook, had not only prepared meals but also altered their clothes to suit the summer weather.</p>

                        <p>During this time, they hadn't encountered any signs of other people since their relocation. However, their sense of tranquility was shattered when Harris returned from a hunting trip with a grave revelation.</p>

                        <p>"I saw a man near the end of the river, not far from our camp," Harris informed the girls, his voice filled with urgency. "He was wearing similar clothes to the men who attacked us a few weeks ago."</p>

                        <p>Anxiety etched itself onto their faces as they listened intently to Harris's words. The memories of the brutal encounter resurfaced, fueling their determination to confront this potential threat head-on.</p>

                        <p>"What's the plan?" Nikki asked, her voice laced with a mix of apprehension and determination.</p>

                        <p>Harris paused for a moment, formulating a plan in his mind. "We're going to ambush him and hold him for questioning," he replied, his voice steady. "We need to know who he is and why he's here."</p>

                        <p>Gathering their weapons and dressing in dark clothing, the group set off, their hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and anticipation. Harris led them to the river, where the man had been spotted. As they took their positions,
                            adrenaline coursed through their veins.</p>

                        <p>Harris slowly approached the man, his rifle pointed directly at him. "Put down your bow!" he commanded, his voice firm and commanding.</p>

                        <p>The man turned calmly to face Harris, his expression devoid of emotion. He did not flinch or show any signs of fear. Mal and Nikki emerged from the bushes, positioning themselves behind the man.</p>

                        <p>As tension hung in the air, the man reached for a knife tucked in his side pocket. Reacting swiftly, Harris shot the man in the leg. A groan escaped the man's lips as he fell to the ground, the thump reverberating through the silence.</p>

                        <p>The man, now injured and at their mercy, unexpectedly held the knife to his throat. Shock rippled through the group as they stood frozen in disbelief. Nikki's pleas and screams echoed, desperate for him to put the knife down.</p>

                        <p>Time seemed to stand still as the man's calm voice cut through the air. "For the group," he stated with eerie composure before driving the knife into his own throat. Blood trickled down his chest as his life slipped away.</p>

                        <p>They stood in a circle around the lifeless body, a mix of confusion, shock, and sorrow clouding their thoughts. The answers they had sought had been extinguished along with the man's life, leaving them with more questions than
                            before.
