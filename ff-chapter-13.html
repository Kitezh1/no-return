                        </p>

                        <p>Nytro and Dalia spent a few days putting together a map of the area, as they searched for Nytro's family. Although they were unsuccessful, they had got a better understanding of the area.</p>

                        <p>Nikki during this time continued to improve her hunting skills, but it was already difficult with most animals being uneatable due to the strange purple blood. But she was able to find some rabbits that seemed normal.</p>

                        <p>The trio gathered around the campfire and began to eat some cooked rabbit and rice. Nytro told stories about his son and wife, bonding closer with the women. Nikki stood up to get water when she noticed a man running towards the
                            cave.
                        </p>

                        <p>Nikki recognised it was the man they had been visited by before, but this time he looked panicked... scared. Nikki reassured Dalia and Nytro that the man was okay.</p>

                        <p>He approached them, Pablo introduced himself to Dalia and Nytro. He explained in a panic that his tribe's camp was being attacked by this same group, and he desperately needed their help.</p>

                        <p>Nikki instantly agreed to help, while Dalia & Nytro were undecided but followed anyways.</p>

                        <p>The group ventured towards his camp, but found everyone dead and the camp burning down. Pablo begins to cry and begs them to help him recover the bodies. Dalia says the fire is too big to go in there. He understands but collapses
                            to his knees.</p>

                        <p>Nikki says they need to track them down. Nytro says that would be too risky, but Pablo interrupts and agrees. Dalia says Nytro is right, and they decide not to go. Nikki follows Pablo into the forest to track down the attackers.</p>

                        <p>Through the forest they found muddy footprints, looking to be just a few footsteps. They followed the path and eventually saw a campfire with several tents.</p>

                        <p>They talked about a plan, Pablo explaining they should kill them in their sleep, to be stealthy. Nikki began to feel sick in her stomach, but knew she couldn't back out now.</p>

                        <p>They crouched and slowly approached the silent camp. Nikki held the cloth back, exposing a woman laying asleep with a gun beside her, blood on her clothes. Nikki raised her knife and slowly made her way closer. She sliced the knife
                            across her neck, blood spilling everywhere. The woman briefly opened her eyes in shock, but eventually stopped moving.</p>

                        <p>A scuffle was heard outside, Nikki shot up and saw Pablo being pinned down by a large guy. He held a knife over him, and Pablo was barely holding on. Nikki snuck up behind him, jabbing her knife into his back. The man collapsed
                            to the floor. Pablo stood over him and stabbed the man over and over again.</p>

                        <p>Nikki looked away, looking down at her blood-covered hands. She realized they were never getting out of here, there was no return.</p>
