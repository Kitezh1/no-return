                        </p>

                        <p>Mal and Nikki stood face-to-face with the feral wolf, rain crashing down around them. They took slow steps backward, but the wolf's howl pierced the air, and it charged towards them. Mal aimed her revolver and fired, grazing the
                            wolf's left leg. Yet, the creature didn't relent.</p>

                        <p>The wolf lunged at Mal, latching onto her ankle and forcefully throwing her to the ground. Pain seared through her, and she let out a piercing shriek. Acting swiftly, Nikki grabbed the dropped revolver, taking aim. A deafening
                            bang reverberated through the forest as the bullet found its mark. The feral animal collapsed, lifeless, beside Mal's injured leg.</p>

                        <p>Nikki hastily dragged the wolf's body off Mal, helping her friend to her feet. With great effort, they made their way back to camp, and as they reached the safety of the cave, Mal's pain overwhelmed her, causing her to collapse.
                            Though their medical supplies were scarce, Nikki managed to clean the wound and sew it shut using a needle and some string.</p>

                        <p>The following hours passed with Nikki remaining vigilant, constantly monitoring Mal's temperature and signs of infection. The weight of the situation pressed heavily upon her. The thought of losing both Harris and Mal, and being
                            left alone in the unforgiving wilderness, filled her with an unrelenting dread. As the morning sun began to rise, Nikki found herself physically and mentally exhausted, having stayed awake throughout the night. She checked
                            on Mal one last time before extinguishing the campfire outside the cave and settling down beside her.</p>

                        <p>Nikki's eyelids grew heavy, and she was on the verge of slumber when a sudden darkness enveloped her senses. Startled, she sat up, opening her eyes. To her astonishment, outside the cave, it was night again. Disbelief washed over
                            her as she cautiously stepped out, her gaze fixed on the sky above. An eclipse was unfolding, the shadow of the moon gradually obscuring the sun, casting the rainforest into an eerie darkness.</p>

                        <p>The realization sank in that something was profoundly amiss. Time seemed to have lost its grip, and the boundaries of reality blurred before Nikki's eyes. Uncertainty and apprehension swelled within her as she grappled with the
                            incomprehensible phenomenon unfolding in the sky above. Determined to make sense of it all, Nikki resolved to uncover the secrets hidden within the darkness and find a way to guide herself and Mal out of this disorienting wilderness.</p>
